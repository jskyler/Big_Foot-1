    <h2 style="text-align:center"> Bigfoot vs. Man</h2>
    <p style="margin-left: 40px">Our goal for this machine learning project was to build a Convolutional Neural Network with the ability to classify images as either representing Bigfoot or man. While this project uses a relatively small data set (1170 pictures), it represents a first step in the building of a larger model that could help Cyrptozoologists and Bigfoot enthusiasts determine the credibility of their bigfoot sightings.</p>

        <li>Pictures were numbered sequentially as either bigfoot or man and saved as JPEG files (example: bigfoot1.jpg) </li>
